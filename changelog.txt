Changelog

- File structure changed to match the IEEE standard
- Symbols that alias another function moved to `symbols.jl`
- Removed global precision
- `make_interval` renamed `wrap_literals`
- Removed `pi_interval(T)` in favor of `Interval{T}(π)`
- Renamed `multiply_by_positive_constant` to `scale`
- `@round` now take the flavor of the returned interval as first argument
- Removed `find_quadrants_tan` as it was a duplicate of `find_quadrants`
- Renamed `mid(a, α)` -> `scaled_mid(a, α)` (to avoid discrepency with default parameter)
- Functions returning intervals based on bound type now required a flavor type as parameter
- Renamed `entireinterval` -> `RR`
- Added check of the "IA_DEFAULT_FLAVOR" and "IA_DEFAULT_BOUND_TYPE" keys in `ENV` to get the flavor (`Interval`) and bound type (`DefaultBound`). The default interval type is thus `Interval{DefaultBound}`.
